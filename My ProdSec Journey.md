# Why Product Security is the Next Evolution of AppSec

**By Ivan Piskunov, Product Security Strategist**

For years, my world was defined by code scanners and pipeline gates. As an AppSec and DevSecOps engineer, my mission was tactical: find the vulnerability, secure the container, harden the CI/CD pipeline. I spoke the language of CVSS scores and SAST rules. It was crucial work, but it was a view of security through a keyhole.

My perspective shifted when I became a Security Champion for a fintech company. I stepped back from the terminal and consoles and into the conference room. My role was no longer just about *how* to secure a component, but *why* it mattered. I became a translator, explaining technical risks to product managers and justifying security budgets to executives. I was building bridges between engineering and the business.

But I soon realized there was a ceiling. We were excellently securing *what we built*, but we weren't always questioning *what we should build* and *how it would behave in the real world*. We were missing the forest for the trees. This realization led me to my true calling: **Product Security (ProdSec)**.

In the US tech landscape, especially in automotive, aerospace, and medical device industries, ProdSec is a well-established, critical function. Elsewhere, it’s often misunderstood or lumped in with AppSec. It is so much more. Product Security isn't a task; it's a strategic mindset. It’s the discipline of managing the security, safety, and trustworthiness of a product as a whole—from its conception to its decommissioning in a customer's environment.

#### **AppSec and DevSecOps are the "How?" Product Security is the "Why?"**

To understand ProdSec, it’s essential to see how it builds upon and differs from its foundational layers:

| Dimension | **Application Security (AppSec)** | **DevSecOps** | **Product Security (ProdSec)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | **Securing the Code** | **Securing the Process** | **Securing the Business Outcome** |
| **Scope** | A single application or repository. | The CI/CD pipeline and development toolchain. | **The entire product ecosystem:** Code, hardware, cloud services, APIs, 3rd-party components, **and the customer's use case.** |
| **Primary Goal** | Find and fix vulnerabilities. | Automate and integrate security into development. | **Ensure the product is inherently secure, compliant, and worthy of customer trust.** |
| **Key Metrics** | # of flaws, scan coverage, MTTR. | Pipeline throughput, security gate efficacy. | **Risk metrics, compliance status, time-to-certification, customer audit results.** |
| **Mindset** | Tactical ("Is this function safe?") | Operational ("Is our process secure?") | **Strategic ("Does this product create unacceptable liability? Is its security a market advantage?")** |

AppSec and DevSecOps are vital, but they are functions *within* the engineering organization. Product Security is a strategic, cross-functional discipline that sits at the product level, interfacing with engineering, legal, sales, support, and the C-suite.

#### **The Five Pillars of a Modern Product Security Program**

So, what does a Product Security Manager actually *do*? My focus has shifted from engineering tasks to these core pillars:

1.  **Security-by-Design & Proactive Threat Modeling:** We engage at the product ideation and architecture phase. Before a single line of code is written, we ask: "What are the worst-case scenarios? How could this be abused?" We facilitate threat modeling for the entire system, not just individual features, ensuring security is an architectural foundation, not a bolt-on.

2.  **Compliance & Certification Architecture:** This is paramount in high-stakes industries. For software in a Boeing aircraft or a modern car, compliance with standards like DO-326A or ISO 21434/UN R155 isn't optional—it's the price of entry. My role isn't to just pass an audit; it's to **architect the product from the ground up to be certifiable.** This avoids catastrophic delays and costs down the line and is a powerful market differentiator.

3.  **Third-Party & Supply Chain Risk Management:** A modern product is a mosaic of proprietary code, open-source libraries, and third-party APIs. ProdSec owns the process of vetting every component that enters the supply chain, understanding its security posture, and having a plan for when (not if) a vulnerability is discovered in a dependency. The SolarWinds incident is a permanent lesson in this domain.

4.  **Product-Specific Incident Response:** When a vulnerability is found in a deployed product, the stakes are immense. This isn't just a web app patch. This could involve millions of physical devices (cars, routers, medical devices) in the field. ProdSec leads the cross-functional response: assessing customer impact, managing coordinated disclosure, and orchestrating complex firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) update campaigns.

5.  **Customer Trust & Transparency:** In B2B deals, security is a contract term. I am now the interface for customer security questionnaires, the creator of our security whitepapers, and the architect of our product's security SLAs (e.g., "Critical patches within 72 hours"). This transparency builds trust and becomes a tangible competitive advantage.

#### **The Ultimate Stake: It's Not Just Data, It's Lives**

This is what truly separates ProdSec from other security disciplines. In my previous roles, a security breach meant a data leak. A serious event, yes, but often manageable. In the realm of ProdSec for critical systems, a security flaw can directly lead to a **functional safety failure**.

A hacked car's braking system, a compromised avionics module, a hijacked medical device—these are not IT incidents. They are existential events that risk human life and entail monumental liability. Product Security is where the worlds of **cybersecurity and functional safety converge**. We are the last line of defense against these catastrophic outcomes, ensuring that security is baked into the very soul of the product.

#### **The Path Forward: Embracing the Strategic Role**

For engineers and Security Champions feeling the pull toward this strategic horizon, the path requires a shift in mindset:

*   **Move from Technical to Business Risk:** Learn to quantify security issues in terms of financial impact, liability, and brand reputation.
*   **Develop Executive Communication:** Translate technical vulnerabilities into business narratives that resonate with the C-suite.
*   **Build a Cross-Functional Network:** Your influence is your new toolkit. Cultivate strong relationships with Product Management, Legal, and Sales.

Product Security is not the next job title; it's the evolution of security from a technical function to a core business competency. It’s the recognition that in a world run by software, the security, safety, and trustworthiness of your product are ultimately your most valuable assets.

The question for leaders isn't whether they can afford to invest in Product Security, but whether they can afford the catastrophic cost of not doing so.
