## What is a Product Security Manager?
A Product Security Manager plays a critical role in protecting an organizationâ€™s products throughout the software development lifecycle. This position is central to safeguarding the integrity and reliability of products by managing security strategies and ensuring robust defenses against vulnerabilities. In todayâ€™s dynamic technological environment, a dedicated product security professional helps build trust with customers and stakeholders by implementing proactive security measures.

A security product manager orchestrates the development and success of a security product or feature by bridging customer needs, business objectives, security risks, compliance requirements, and technological capabilities. They navigate through market research, regulations and standards, strategy formulation, requirements, and cross-functional team leadership to launch and refine products that fulfill market demands, exceed user expectations, and set new benchmarks for safety, compliance, and reliability.


## What Does a Product Security Manager Do?
The Product Security Manager collaborates closely with teams across engineering, product development, and quality assurance to integrate security best practices into every stage of production. They are responsible for leading initiatives such as threat modeling, security testing, and vulnerability management. By continually monitoring and assessing the security landscape, they ensure that the organization is equipped to respond to emerging threats effectively.

## Key Responsibilities
A Product Security Manager typically:

Leads enterprise-level security initiatives.
Collaborates with cross-functional teams to integrate security into the SDLC.

## What is the difference between IT security and product security?
Product security ensures that your software is built securely, while IT security protects your company's infrastructure and employees. Both are critical, but this series will focus on product securityâ€”helping you build security into your software development lifecycle from the ground up.

Why is product security important?
Strong product security helps prevent source code leaks, reverse engineering, and IP theft to protect your company's competitive edge. Reduce Risk of Breaches: By identifying and fixing security issues across the SDLC, product security reduces the likelihood of vulnerabilities making it into production.
