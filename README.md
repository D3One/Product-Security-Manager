## Introduction

Product security is a holistic approach to embedding security into digital products and services throughout their entire lifecycle—from initial design and development to deployment and ongoing maintenance. It aims to protect against tampering, cyberattacks, data breaches, and counterfeiting by integrating security practices like threat modeling, secure coding, and continuous monitoring into the product ecosystem. Product security focuses on the product and its entire ecosystem, differentiating it from application security, which concentrates on securing the code itself. 

## Product security framework

Improving product security requires a holistic approach that addresses hardware, software, and process vulnerabilities. Use this framework to identify common security challenges and fortify your products:

- Threat modeling
- Secure design principles
- Secure development lifecycle
- Vulnerability management
- Supply chain security
- Secure deployment
- Security incident report
- Continuous monitoring
- Training and awareness

Defining product security implications for each industry
Now that we understand the importance of Product Security, how can we define it? Let’s break it down:

### Cars

Vehicles rely on a highly complex software supply chain that includes both custom and open source software, much of which is structured within the AUTOSAR architecture. In addition, much of this software is capable of remote access, opening it up to potential vulnerabilities.
OEMs and their suppliers work tirelessly to scan their code and find any potential for threat-related manipulation. However, with millions of lines of code per vehicle (some more than a modern fighter jet), it’s a daunting task that can’t be achieved with manual combing.

A full product security approach is needed, including threat modeling, vulnerability management, and implementation of a cybersecurity management system (CSMS) to generate reports and comply with regulations. Once these are completed, companies can comply with WP.29 and begin building their product security incident response team (PSIRT).

### Medical devices

Patient care relies on accurate, secure, and uninterrupted service from machines that operate in facilities and in patient homes. The safety risk for medical devices range from risk to life or limb to a diminished quality of care, resulting from inaccurate readings. 

The high reliance on these devices also makes them a prized target for threat actors to hold a person or facility at ransom, potentially denying them the life-saving services they rely on. The problem becomes increasingly complex when considering that these devices are made up of potentially hundreds of embedded components, each with their own vulnerabilities. 

While inaccurate readings may seem like an inconvenience, it can be the difference between life and death considering that today’s connected devices include MRI machines, infusion pumps, insulin pumps, and homecare devices that allow for a higher quality of life with remote monitoring.

###  Industrial manufacturing and critical infrastructure (SCADA, etc)

Industrial equipment and critical infrastructure have increasingly become software-defined devices. This mixing of potentially legacy devices fixed upon even older non-connected devices leaves these highly prized targets exposed to safety and security concerns which can impact large regions and population centers. These connected products are prone to attacks by malicious state-sponsored groups or prize-seeking hacking groups who can hold entire utilities for ransom.

Product security addresses these by understanding the unique mosaic of tools that operate on both critical infrastructure and manufacturing systems. At the same time, the US government is enhancing its reporting capabilities with CISA’s RVWP initiative and by implementing SBOM & VEX minimums.

### Attention!!! Product Secuirty is not AppSec or DevSecOps
